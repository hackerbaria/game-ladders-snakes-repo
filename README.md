# MVP game
Make a game where the goal is to reach 50 points. Add five random snakes and ladders to the board.<br>
Using the console, the player may input their names (one or more) or leave them blank to finish the mission.<br>
At the start of each player, a random number (dice roll) is selected and the player's number is moved to that number on the board, if possible.<br>
The player should be transferred to their last square if they land at the foot of the ladder or the head of the snake.<br>
Each player's movements and modifications should be recorded in the console.<br>
Finally, as the game draws to a close, the player must roll the precise number in order to reach the conclusion and win the game itself.<br>

# Dynamic expansion - Bonus
We'd want to be able to customise the number of board squares, the number of snakes and ladders without having to alter the game's code.<br>
For example, set 10 snakes and 20 ladders on the board with 100 number of squares.<br>
